The script defines two endpoints, /shorten and /<short_url>. The /shorten endpoint is used to generate a shortened URL for a given long URL. It expects a JSON payload containing the long URL and returns a JSON response containing the shortened URL.

The /shorten endpoint first checks if the long URL is already in the in-memory url_map dictionary. If it is, it returns the corresponding shortened URL. If not, it generates a new unique ID for the long URL using the generate_id function and adds the mapping to the url_map dictionary. It then returns the shortened URL.

The generate_id function generates a unique ID for a given URL using the MD5 hash algorithm and base64 encoding. The resulting ID is shorter and easier to read than the MD5 hash, making it a good candidate for a shortened URL.

The /<short_url> endpoint is used to expand a shortened URL back to its original long URL. It looks up the shortened URL in the url_map dictionary and redirects the user to the corresponding long URL using a HTTP 301 status code. If the shortened URL is not found in the url_map dictionary, it returns a JSON response with an error message and a HTTP 404 status code.

The script can be run directly using the if name == '__main__' block at the bottom, which starts the Flask web server on the localhost at port 5000. Note that the app.config['SERVER_NAME'] setting is used to specify the server name and port that the application should be served on.
